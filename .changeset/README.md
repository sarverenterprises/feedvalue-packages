# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select the packages that have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of your changes

## Releasing

When ready to release:

```bash
pnpm version    # Updates versions based on changesets
pnpm release    # Builds and publishes to npm
```
